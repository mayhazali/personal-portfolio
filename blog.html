      <h2>Pointillism</h2><br>
      <h3>Pride</h3><br>

      <p class="blog_text">
        When I was in middle school, my art teacher taught my class Pointillism.
        Wikipedia defines Pointillism as a technique of painting in which small, 
        distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.
        My teacher showed us "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat 
        as an example of Pointillism. 
        The teacher asked us to make our own Pointillism pictures.
        The criteria was that our picture had to include at least five items.
        <br><br>
        The picture above is the Pointalism peice I created.
        When I showed my work to the teacher she said it might be one of the best
        Pointalism pictures she had ever seen a student make. Later,
        I saw my art up on the school website. This is why I am proud of this picture.
        I have two tips for those who want to try their hand at Pointillism.
        Close up items shoud be detailed and clear, 
        but far away items can be less detailed and to create an ombre effect you can
        use different shades of the same color to ease into a new color.

      <h2>Origami</h2><br>
      <h3>Me and Origami</h3><br>
      <p class="blog_text">
        As a middle school student, I was interested in origami 
        (the Japanese art of paper folding). 
        I would get 'How To Do Origami' books from the school library and 
        I would fold pieces of paper into interesting shapes or animals. 
        Sometimes the instructions were confusing and I would get frustrated, 
        but I could get through it if persevered.
        I made foxes, flowers, boxes, butterflies, etc.

      <h3>The Butterfly Bucket</h3><br>

      <p>
        I have a whole container full of origami butterflies 
        of all colors and sizes that live in my closet.

      <h3>The Dragon</h3><br>

      <p class="blog_text"><br><br>
        The last origami figure I made was an origami dragon. 
        I learned how to make it from watching a youtube video. 
        Whenever I look at it, I feel proud that I made something so cool. 
        Now the dragon lives in my drawer and guards a toy treasure chest.
